This file contains codes after chaning the code and addiing multiple schemas. But some how it didn't worked as per our expectations.
1. Server:- It is the file for server starting te server.
2. api:- It is the file for using POST nd GET according to user.
3. product:- It is the file for defining the multiple schemas.

I am attaching the screen shot. of the error and program. U can see in the database schema name is anaschemas but i gave the name anaschema also why the data is stored on anaschema by itself i didn't understand that.
